          <h2>CLIMATE CHANGE</h2>
          <p>
            Climate change is the significant variation of average weather
            conditions becoming, for example, warmer, wetter, or drierâ€”over
            several decades or longer. It is the longer-term trend that
            differentiates climate change from natural weather variability.
